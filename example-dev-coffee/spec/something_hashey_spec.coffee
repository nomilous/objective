objective ->

    #
    # Objective can be passed as an anonymous funtion
    # without config or title.
    # 
    #         Silly not to title it tho...
    # 
    #   eg.
    #         objective 'Make Fluffy Cloud Float Slowly North', ->
    #        
    # 
    #
    # Injection also works at the root, but only for
    # node modules and [objective globals].
    # 
    # And it does not attach the mocker (.does())
    #
    #   eg.
    #         objective (cloud) ->
    #         
    #              # do some stuff with cloud
    #

    # throw new Error('E');
